# This script attempts to process a large file line by line,
# but it fails due to an inefficient approach and potential issues 
# with line buffering and file descriptor limits.

filename="large_file.txt"

while IFS= read -r line; do
  # Process each line
  # ...some processing...
  echo "Processing: $line"
done < "$filename"

# The processing within the loop is slow, causing performance problems 
# with extremely large files. Also, if the file exceeds the operating
# system's limits for open files or buffer size, unexpected errors may occur.

#Additional issues:
#1. No error handling for the case when the file does not exist.
#2. Limited memory management for large lines.  If a line is excessively long,
# it can still cause issues
